    "### Conclusion\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This notebook explored multiple preprocessing techniques and models (from logistic regression to deep neural networks) for the Rainfall Prediction task. We:\r\n",
    "- Experimented with five preprocessing pipelines.\r\n",
    "- Ran hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV with 5-fold CV.\r\n",
    "- Trained a variety of models including tree-based methods, boosting (XGB, LGB, CatBoost), and a DNN.\r\n",
    "- Generated submission files for each combination.\r\n",
    "- Compared model performance using ROC AUC and extracted feature importances for the top 3 models.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Feel free to build on this “super code” by refining hyperparameters, ensembling models, or adding additional feature engineering steps. Happy modeling and good luck in the cometition!\r\n"
